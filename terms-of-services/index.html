Our notice to you will be sent electronically in accordance with this Agreement and will include (x) our name, postal address, telephone number and an email address at which we can be contacted with respect to the Dispute, (y) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (z) the specific relief that we are seeking. If you and Safe Securities cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or Safe Securities may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section, commence an arbitration proceeding.</p><li class="sf-list sf-list-lower-alpha">Process</li><p class="sf-text-terms">EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES IN WHICH EITHER PARTY SEEKS TO BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT OR SEEKS INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FOR THE ALLEGED UNLAWFUL USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, TRADE NAMES, LOGOS, TRADE SECRETS OR PATENTS, YOU AND Safe Securities AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE MUST BE COMMENCED OR FILED BY YOU OR Safe Securities WITHIN (1) YEAR OF THE DATE THE DISPUTE AROSE, OTHERWISE THE UNDERLYING CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED (WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AND Safe Securities WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT SUCH CLAIM REGARDING THE DISPUTE). You and Safe Securities agree that (a) any arbitration will occur in Santa Clara County, California, (b) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section, and (c) that the state or federal courts of the State of California, have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county of your billing address if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.</p><li class="sf-list sf-list-lower-alpha">Authority of Arbitrator</li><p class="sf-text-terms">As limited by the FAA, these Terms of Service and the applicable AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitral, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms of Service. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding, or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or the applicable AAA Rules, discovery in the arbitration shall be limited to one set of interrogatories, one set of requests for admissions, and one set of requests for production of documents.</p><p class="sf-text-terms">The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. We will not seek and hereby waive all rights we may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration.</p><li class="sf-list sf-list-lower-alpha">Rules of AAA</li><p class="sf-text-terms">The AAA Rules are available at https://www.adr.org/Rules or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms of Service, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of AAA, or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of AAA and any claim that the rules of AAA are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p><li class="sf-list sf-list-lower-alpha">Severability</li><p class="sf-text-terms">If any term, clause or provision of this Section is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth herein are severable from the other provisions of this Agreement and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law. </p><li class="sf-list sf-list-lower-alpha">Opt-Out Right</li><p class="sf-text-terms">YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF THE DATE YOU FIRST ACCEPTED THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION BY WRITING TO: Safe Securities, RE: OPT-OUT, [PHYSICAL ADDRESS]. IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE, THE OPT OUT NOTICE MUST INCLUDE YOUR FULL NAME AND CLEARLY INDICATE YOUR INTENT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION. BY OPTING OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU ARE AGREEING TO RESOLVE DISPUTES IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 21. </p></ol></li><li> <span class="sf-text-terms-bold">MISCELLANEOUS</span><p class="sf-text-terms">This Agreement along with our <a href="../privacy-policy/index.html">Privacy Policy</a> constitutes the entire agreement between you and Safe Securities and supersedes any prior agreements between you and Safe Securities with respect to the subject matter herein. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, we both nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to our intentions as reflected in this provision, and the other provisions of this Agreement to remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our Website, App, or Platform or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A party’s failure to act with respect to a breach by the other party does not constitute a waiver of the party’s right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. All the sections intended to survive the termination of this Agreement shall survive. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any notices to Safe Securities shall be given by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested to Safe Securities at 3000 El Camino Real, Building 4, Suite 200, Palo Alto, CA 94306, USA. Any notices to you shall be provided to you through our Website, App, or Platform or given to you via the email address or physical address you provide to Safe Securities during the registration
